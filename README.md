## 🚀 What is this?
This project answers one question: **How do we keep a motorcycle stable at high speeds?**

I designed a custom fairing in **Fusion 360** and tested it in a virtual wind tunnel using **Ansys Fluent**. The goal was to make the bike slice through the air cleanly while keeping the front wheel glued to the road.

## 💥 The Results (The Cool Stuff)
I ran the simulation at **120 km/h**, and here is what happened:

* ✅ **It Cuts Drag:** The design is highly efficient, matching professional touring bikes.
* ✅ **It Generates Downforce:** Unlike most basic designs that lift off the ground, **my design pushes down (-19N)**. This gives the rider better grip and steering control.
* ✅ **It's Stable:** I mapped the airflow and found exactly where the wind turbulence happens (behind the windshield), so I know how to fix it in version 2.0.

## 📂 What's Inside?
* **3D Models:** The actual CAD files of the bike.
* **Simulation Data:** The proof that the physics works.
* **The Report:** A full PDF explaining every step.
* **Cool Pictures:** Colorful airflow visualizations in the `/Images` folder.

## 🤖 AI Note
* **Text:** I used AI to help format the report and make it look professional.
* **Engineering:** The 3D modeling, the simulation setup, and the physics analysis were **100% done by me**.
